Monte Carlo simulator for a stock's daily price movements. Default settings assume an expected 10% increase over the course of one year containing 252 trading days, and will simulate 21 trading days (1/12th of a year) one million times. The use of NumPy makes even one million simulations quite fastâ€”less than 2 seconds on my machine.
